# Project Overview

This project is focused on machine learning analysis of PDF files. The goal is to classify PDF files based on certain features, such as file size, into two classes: malicious and non-malicious. The dataset used for this project is stored in `dataset.csv`.

The project uses several machine learning algorithms for the classification task, including:

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes

The project also addresses the issue of imbalanced data by applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data.

The code for this project is in the Jupyter notebook file `main.ipynb`. The results of the machine learning models' evaluation are stored in `results/results.csv`.

## How to Run the Notebook (VS Code Jupyter Extension)

1. **Install VS Code and Extensions:**
    Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed, along with the Jupyter extension. You can install the Jupyter extension from the Extensions Marketplace in VS Code.

2. **Open the Notebook:**
    Open the `main.ipynb` file in VS Code.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
    You can run the cells directly in VS Code by clicking on the "Run" button that appears above each cell or by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` / `Control + Enter` (MacOS keyboard).
